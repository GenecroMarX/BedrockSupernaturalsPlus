There is no default namespace, use a genecic form of your username as the namespace for every add-on elemeent you submit. For example, I, GenecroMarX, will use the namespace "genecro" for my custom entities.

Make sure that you own or have the permission for the mobs or any other add-on elements that are to be submitted. Do not forget insert your name inside your files (as a comment) to make sure that we'll be able to track who made what.

It is also best to ensure that the codes are working before submitting them to the repository.
