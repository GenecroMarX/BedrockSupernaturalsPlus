The default namespace is "supernaturals" and the files should be properly nested as shown in .BP/ and .RP/.

Make sure that you are the legitimate owner of the mobs or any other add-on elements that are to be submitted. Do not forget insert your name inside your files (as a comment) to make sure that we'll be able to track who made what.

It is also best to ensure that the codes are working before submitting them to the repository.
